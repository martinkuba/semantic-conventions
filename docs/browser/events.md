# Semantic conventions for browser events

**Status**: [Development][DocumentStatus]

This document defines semantic conventions for browser (web) instrumentations
that emit events.

## Page View Event

<!-- semconv event.browser.page_view -->

The event name MUST be `browser.page_view`.

This event represents a browser page load/view.

The primary use case is to capture metrics about the number of views of a page. Page view can be a hard page load in a browser as well as virtual navigation in a SPA (single-page application). The event should be collected as soon as possible without waiting for potentially delayed data such as the Navigation timing browser API.

**Body fields:**

:warning: Body fields will be moved to complex attributes once the
semantic convention tooling supports complex attributes
(see [#1870](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/issues/1870)).

| Body Field  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `change_state` | string | Type of state change used for the virtual page navigation | `pushState`; `replaceState` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `referrer` | string | Referring Page URI (document.referrer) whenever available. | `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `title` | string | Page title DOM property | `Home`; `Checkout` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `type` | enum | Type of navigation | `0`; `1` | `Required` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `url` | string | Full HTTP request URL in the form scheme://host[:port]/path?query[#fragment]. Usually the fragment is not transmitted over HTTP, but if it is known, it should be included nevertheless. | `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page`; `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#foo` | `Required` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

`type` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description | Stability |
|---|---|---|
| `0` | Initial page load within the browser which will generally also precede a PageNavigationTiming event. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `1` | This is for Single Page Applications (SPA) where the framework provides the ability to perform client side only page "navigation", the exact definition of what a virtual page change is determined by the SPA and the framework it is using. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

    brief: >
      This event describes the timing metrics of a page navigation as provided
      by the PerformanceNavigationTiming Performance API.
    note: >
      This event captures data from the [Navigation Timing API](https://www.w3.org/TR/navigation-timing-2/).
      It is recommended to be captured by using the PerformanceObserver API, or
      when the window load event fires. If the page starts unloading before
      the page loads, then the partial data can be captured by calling the
      [performance.getEntriesByType][https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance/getEntriesByType]
      method.

      This event definition elevates a few key data points to body fields in
      order to make it easier to access. In addition, the complete set of data
      from the API may be sent in the body of the event as stringified JSON.

            The time immediately before the browser starts to fetch the
